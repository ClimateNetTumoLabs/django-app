# django-ebhealthcheck

![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/django-ebhealthcheck)

By default, Elastic Beanstalk's health check system uses the public IP of each
load balanced instance as the request's host header when making a request.
Unless added to `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, this causes Django to return a `400 Bad
Request` and a failed health check.

This app dynamically adds your instance's public IP address to Django's
`ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting to permit health checks to succeed. This happens upon
application start.

Version 2.0.0 and higher supports IMDSv2. If you are using v1 and cannot upgrade,
use version 1 of this library instead (`pip install django-ebhealthcheck<2.0.0`).

## Installation

1. `pip install django-ebhealthcheck`
2. Add `ebhealthcheck.apps.EBHealthCheckConfig` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`:

   ```
   INSTALLED_APPS = [
       ...
       'ebhealthcheck.apps.EBHealthCheckConfig',
       ...
   ]
   ```
